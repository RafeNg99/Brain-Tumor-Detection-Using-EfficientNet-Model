# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-EfficientNet-Model

## Introduction
I have built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using EfficientNet-B4 in PyTorch to detect brain tumor in MRI images.

About the data:
The dataset consists of 155 images with brain tumor (designated here as 1) and 98 images without brain tumor (designated here as 0) and these images are split into three different sets: training, validation ans test sets. You may find the images [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
